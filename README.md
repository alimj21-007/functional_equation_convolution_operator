# Functional Equation via Compact Convolution Operators

This repository accompanies the second paper in an operator-theoretic research program exploring zeta-type identities. It presents a new functional equation constructed via a compact convolution-type integral operator, with numerical evaluation of its Fredholm determinant.

## üîç Overview

- Constructs a convolution-type kernel \( K_s(x, y) \) with trace-class properties
- Defines a functional equation \( \Xi(s) = \det(I - K_s) \) with zeta-like symmetry
- Implements discretization, spectral analysis, and determinant computation
- Supports analytic continuation and numerical experiments in the critical strip
