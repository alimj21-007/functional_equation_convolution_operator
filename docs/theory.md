# Spectral Theory and Fredholm Determinants in the Study of the Riemann Zeta Function

## 1. Introduction

Paper 2 explores a spectral-analytic framework for investigating the Riemann zeta function via Fredholm determinants of integral operators. The goal is to construct a numerically tractable and theoretically meaningful operator \(\Xi(s) := \det(I - K_s)\) that mirrors the behavior of \(\zeta(s)\) along the critical line \(\Re(s) = 0.5\).

## 2. Fredholm Determinants and Kernel Operators

Let \(K_s\) be a compact integral operator defined on a suitable Hilbert space, with kernel \(K_s(x, y)\) depending on a complex parameter \(s\). The Fredholm determinant is defined as:
\[
\Xi(s) := \det(I - K_s)
\]
This determinant encodes spectral information about \(K_s\) and serves as an analytic function that can be compared to \(\zeta(s)\) in terms of magnitude, symmetry, and zero distribution.

## 3. Connection to the Riemann Zeta Function

The classical Riemann zeta function is defined for \(\Re(s) > 1\) by:
\[
\zeta(s) = \sum_{n=1}^{\infty} \frac{1}{n^s}
\]
and extended to the complex plane via analytic continuation. The critical line \(\Re(s) = 0.5\) is of particular interest due to the Riemann Hypothesis. In this framework, we compare \(|\Xi(s)|\) and \(|\zeta(s)|\) numerically to assess alignment and divergence.

## 4. Functional Equation and Symmetry

The zeta function satisfies a functional equation:
\[
\Xi(s) = \Xi(1 - s)
\]
We investigate whether the Fredholm determinant \(\Xi(s)\) inherits this symmetry:
\[
|\Xi(0.5 + it)| \approx |\Xi(0.5 - it)|
\]
This is tested numerically by plotting both sides and measuring their difference across a range of \(t\).

## 5. Numerical Experiments and Visualization

We discretize the kernel \(K_s(x, y)\) over a grid and compute:
- \(|\Xi(s)|\) vs \(|\zeta(s)|\)
- Spectral radius \(\rho(K_s)\)
- Dominant eigenvalue of \(K_s\)
- Symmetry plots for \(\Xi(0.5 + it)\) and \(\Xi(0.5 - it)\)
- Difference plots to quantify asymmetry

These visualizations are saved as PDF files and CSV outputs for reproducibility and public presentation.

## 6. Implications for Zero Distribution

If \(\Xi(s)\) closely tracks \(\zeta(s)\), especially in terms of magnitude and symmetry, it may offer a spectral interpretation of zeta zeros. This could support operator-theoretic approaches to the Riemann Hypothesis and provide new tools for analyzing zero statistics.
