# Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)

This document addresses common questions about the spectral framework and numerical experiments presented in Paper 2.

---

## 1. What is the main goal of Paper 2?

The paper aims to construct and analyze a spectral analogue of the Riemann zeta function using Fredholm determinants of kernel operators. It investigates whether \(\Xi(s) := \det(I - K_s)\) can replicate key features of \(\zeta(s)\), including symmetry, magnitude, and zero behavior along the critical line.

---

## 2. What is the definition of the kernel operator \(K_s\)?

We use a compact integral operator with kernel:
\[
K_s(x, y) = \exp(-s(x - y)^2)
\]
defined over a bounded domain, typically \([0.1, 1.0]\). The parameter \(s = \sigma + it\) varies along the critical line \(\Re(s) = 0.5\).

---

## 3. How is the Fredholm determinant computed?

We discretize the operator \(K_s\) on a uniform grid and compute:
\[
\Xi(s) = \det(I - K_s)
\]
using `numpy.linalg.det`. For stability, we optionally use `slogdet` and normalize by grid size.

---

## 4. How does \(\Xi(s)\) relate to \(\zeta(s)\)?

Numerical plots show that \(|\Xi(s)|\) often tracks \(|\zeta(s)|\) in magnitude and oscillation. This suggests a potential spectral interpretation of zeta behavior, though no formal equivalence is claimed.

---

## 5. Does \(\Xi(s)\) satisfy a functional equation?

We test symmetry numerically:
\[
|\Xi(0.5 + it)| \approx |\Xi(0.5 - it)|
\]
This mirrors the functional equation of \(\zeta(s)\), and deviations are plotted to assess asymmetry.

## 6. What types of outputs are generated?

We produce:
- PDF plots (e.g., `determinate_vs_zeta.pdf`, `spectral_radius_plot.pdf`)
- CSV tables for numerical inspection
- Markdown documentation for reproducibility

All outputs are modular and designed for public presentation.

---

## 7. Is the framework reproducible?

Yes. All scripts are documented and modular. Running `main.py` regenerates all figures and tables. Persian-language documentation and mobile-friendly formats are available.

---

## 8. What are the limitations of this approach?

- The kernel \(K_s\) is heuristic and not derived from first principles.
- Determinant computations are sensitive to grid size and numerical stability.
- No formal proof connects \(\Xi(s)\) to the zeros of \(\zeta(s)\).

---

## 9. How can I contribute or extend this work?

You can:
- Test alternative kernels or domains
- Explore operator-theoretic analogues of other L-functions
- Translate and adapt the framework for outreach or education

## 10. Where can I find the source code and data?

All code, outputs, and documentation are available in the project repository. For access or collaboration, contact the author directly.
