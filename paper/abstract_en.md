# Abstract

This paper develops a spectral framework for analyzing the Riemann zeta function through Fredholm determinants of integral operators. We construct a family of compact kernel operators \( K_s \), parameterized by a complex variable \( s \), and define the associated determinant function \( \Xi(s) := \det(I - K_s) \). Numerical experiments suggest that \( \Xi(s) \) exhibits structural similarities to \( \zeta(s) \), particularly along the critical line \( \Re(s) = 0.5 \).

We investigate whether \( \Xi(s) \) reflects key features of the zeta function, including its symmetry under the functional equation and the distribution of its zeros. By computing spectral radii, dominant eigenvalues, and determinant magnitudes across a range of spectral parameters, we visualize and quantify the alignment between \( \Xi(s) \) and \( \zeta(s) \). The results support the possibility of a spectral interpretation of zeta behavior and open new avenues for operator-theoretic approaches to analytic number theory.

All computations are reproducible, and the framework is designed for modular extension, public presentation, and multilingual accessibility.
